# EcoSync Lite – Architecture Reference

EcoSync Lite is a conceptual, edge-centric energy optimization system architecture designed to improve the operational efficiency of HVAC and electrical loads in industrial and commercial environments.

This repository documents the **system architecture, data flow, control logic, safety mechanisms, and validation philosophy** of EcoSync Lite. It is intended for academic review, design discussion, and architectural reference only.

## Purpose of This Repository
- To present a clear, structured architecture for an edge-based energy optimization system
- To support academic evaluation, design studio review, and system-level reasoning
- To align with a filed patent covering the architectural concepts of the system

## What This Repository Contains
- System-level architecture descriptions
- Conceptual data flow and control logic
- Safety, validation, and monitoring principles
- High-level figures illustrating structure and operation

## What This Repository Does NOT Contain
- No source code
- No executable models
- No deployment scripts
- No hardware schematics or firmware
- No UI or application logic

This intentional separation ensures that the repository remains **non-enabling** and **architecture-focused**.

## Intended Audience
- Students and reviewers evaluating system design
- Researchers studying edge-based energy optimization
- Engineers interested in high-level industrial control architectures

## Figures
The `figures/` directory contains illustrative block diagrams used to explain the system at a conceptual level. These figures are explanatory and not limiting.

## Status
This repository represents an **architecture-only snapshot**. Implementation, simulation, and hardware realization are treated as separate future efforts.
