# Metrics and Validation

System effectiveness is evaluated using clearly defined metrics.

### Energy Metrics
- Electrical energy consumed
- Energy saved relative to baseline

### Comfort Metrics
- Temperature deviation duration
- Comfort boundary violations

### Environmental Metrics
- Estimated carbon emissions avoided
- Time-weighted grid intensity awareness

### System Metrics
- Edge decision latency
- Control reliability

These metrics enable transparent measurement and comparison.
