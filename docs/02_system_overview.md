# System Overview

EcoSync Lite is designed as a modular, edge-centric system that observes energy usage patterns, evaluates operational context, and applies controlled actions to reduce unnecessary consumption.

At a high level, the system consists of:

1. **Sensing and Telemetry**
   Environmental and electrical parameters are observed through distributed sensor nodes.

2. **Edge Intelligence**
   A local edge gateway processes incoming data, applies decision logic, and enforces safety constraints.

3. **Controlled Actuation**
   Electrical loads such as HVAC units and lighting circuits are controlled through isolated relay interfaces.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**
   All decisions and outcomes are logged to enable measurement, verification, and auditability.

The system is designed to function independently at the site level, without reliance on continuous cloud connectivity.
