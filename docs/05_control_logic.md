# Control Logic

EcoSync Lite employs a layered control philosophy.

### Rule-Based Control
Baseline rules enforce:
- Temperature boundaries
- Minimum ON and OFF durations
- Occupancy-based permissions

### Predictive Awareness
Short-horizon forecasting concepts are used to anticipate:
- Temperature drift
- Occupancy transitions
- Load recovery requirements

### Decision Outcome
Control actions are applied only when:
- Safety conditions are satisfied
- Comfort thresholds are respected
- Deferral or reduction is permissible

This hybrid approach balances simplicity with foresight.
