# Assumptions and Limitations

The architecture assumes:
- Simplified thermal behavior models
- Synthetic or estimated occupancy profiles
- Idealized sensor accuracy

Limitations include:
- No direct equipment health modeling
- No site-specific calibration
- No guarantee of absolute savings without deployment tuning

These assumptions are appropriate for architectural validation and early-stage evaluation.
