# Problem Statement

Industrial and large commercial facilities face ongoing challenges in balancing productivity, operational cost, and environmental responsibility. Among all subsystems, HVAC and lighting consistently account for a significant share of total energy consumption.

### Key Problems Identified

1. **Static Operation**
Most HVAC and lighting systems operate on fixed schedules or manual rules that do not adapt to real-time conditions.

2. **Occupancy Mismatch**
Energy is frequently consumed in unoccupied or underutilized zones, especially outside peak working hours.

3. **Lack of Local Intelligence**
Many optimization approaches rely on centralized or cloud-based systems, introducing latency and reducing reliability during connectivity issues.

4. **Carbon Blindness**
Traditional control systems optimize for comfort or cost alone, without accounting for variations in grid-related carbon intensity.

5. **Limited Safety Awareness**
Automated control without strict safety boundaries can cause equipment stress, comfort violations, or operational risk.

These challenges motivate the need for a system that is adaptive, local, safety-aware, and measurable.
